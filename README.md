## Overview

The goal of this project is to forecast daily birth rates using time series analysis. By analyzing historical birth data from 2015, the project employs the ARIMA model, a popular statistical method for time series forecasting, to predict future values. The project includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, demonstrating how time series forecasting can be applied to healthcare data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains daily birth rates from the year 2015. The data is structured with two main columns: `date` and `births`. 

- **Source**: The dataset can be sourced from public birth records or other similar databases.
- **Attributes**:
  - `date`: The date of record.
  - `births`: The number of births recorded on that date.

### Data Preprocessing

The dataset is cleaned and prepared by:
- Setting the `date` column as the index.
- Resampling and visualizing the data to understand trends and patterns.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `sklearn`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/birth-rate-forecasting.git](https://github.com/abrahamoaks/Birth-Rate-Time-Series-Forecasting)
   cd birth-rate-forecasting
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook birth_rate_forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase involves visualizing the birth rate data to identify any patterns or trends. Key steps include:

- **Time Series Plot**: Plotting the birth rates over time to observe general trends, seasonality, and any anomalies.
- **Moving Average**: Applying a moving average to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

## Modeling

The project uses the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for forecasting. Key steps include:

- **Model Training**:
  - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
  - Training an ARIMA model on the training data with selected parameters (`p`, `d`, `q` values).

- **Model Tuning**:
  - Fine-tuning the ARIMA model by adjusting parameters to minimize forecasting error.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric to assess its accuracy. The RMSE compares the predicted birth rates against the actual values in the test set.

- **Naive Forecasting**: As a baseline, the model is compared to a naive approach where the previous day's birth rate is used as the prediction.
- **ARIMA Model Performance**: The ARIMA model's predictions are shown to have a lower RMSE than the naive method, indicating better performance.

## Results

The results show the effectiveness of the ARIMA model in forecasting birth rates:

- **Predictions**: The model successfully predicts daily birth rates with reasonable accuracy.
- **Error Analysis**: The RMSE for the ARIMA model is significantly lower than the naive method, demonstrating its capability in handling time series data.

## Usefulness

This project highlights the importance of time series forecasting in healthcare:

- **Resource Planning**: Accurate birth rate forecasts can help hospitals plan resources, such as staffing and equipment, more effectively.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Predictive analytics can improve decision-making processes in healthcare management.

## Observations

- **Seasonal Trends**: Birth rates exhibit seasonal patterns, with certain times of the year showing higher or lower birth rates.
- **Model Performance**: The ARIMA model provided a good fit for the data, outperforming the naive method.
- **Data Sensitivity**: The model's performance could be further improved with more extensive data covering multiple years.

## Future Contributions

- **Incorporating Additional Data**: Future iterations could use data from multiple years or include external factors like holidays to improve the model's accuracy.
- **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Exploring more advanced models like SARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM networks could enhance forecasting performance.
- **Healthcare System Integration**: The forecasting tool could be integrated into healthcare management systems for real-time resource allocation and planning.
