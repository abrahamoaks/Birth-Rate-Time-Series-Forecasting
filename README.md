## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to forecast daily birth rates using time series analysis techniques. I utilized the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, a popular statistical method for time series forecasting, to predict future birth rates based on historical data from 2015. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, showcasing the effectiveness of time series forecasting in healthcare contexts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains daily birth rates from the year 2015. It includes:

- **Date:** The date of record.
- **Births:** The number of births recorded on that date.

**Source:** The dataset can be sourced from public birth records or similar databases.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset was prepared by:

1. **Indexing:** Setting the date column as the index for easier time series analysis.
2. **Resampling and Visualization:** Aggregating the data to understand trends and patterns and visualizing it to identify seasonal effects and anomalies.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `sklearn`

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/birth-rate-forecasting.git](https://github.com/abrahamoaks/Birth-Rate-Time-Series-Forecasting/blob/main/README.md)
   cd birth-rate-forecasting
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook birth_rate_forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, I performed the following steps to gain insights into the data:

1. **Time Series Plot:** Created plots to observe general trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the birth rate data over time.
2. **Moving Average:** Applied a moving average to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.

## Modeling

For forecasting, I employed the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Key steps included:

1. **Model Training:**

   - **Data Splitting:** Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - **Model Training:** Trained an ARIMA model on the training data with appropriate parameters (p, d, q values).

2. **Model Tuning:**

   - **Parameter Adjustment:** Fine-tuned the ARIMA model by adjusting parameters to minimize forecasting errors.

## Evaluation

I evaluated the model using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric, which measures the accuracy of the predictions. Key evaluation points:

1. **Naive Forecasting:** Compared the ARIMA model's performance to a naive approach that uses the previous day's birth rate as a prediction.
2. **ARIMA Model Performance:** The ARIMA model demonstrated a lower RMSE compared to the naive method, indicating superior performance.

## Observations

- **Seasonal Trends:** Birth rates showed seasonal variations, with fluctuations throughout the year.
- **Model Performance:** The ARIMA model fitted the data well and outperformed the naive forecasting method.
- **Data Sensitivity:** The performance of the model could be improved with additional data spanning multiple years or including other influential factors.

## Results

The results of the project highlight the effectiveness of the ARIMA model:

- **Predictions:** The ARIMA model provided reasonably accurate predictions of daily birth rates.
- **Error Analysis:** The RMSE for the ARIMA model was significantly lower than the naive approach, confirming its capability in time series forecasting.

## Usefulness

This project emphasizes the significance of time series forecasting in healthcare:

- **Resource Planning:** Accurate forecasts of birth rates can assist hospitals in planning resources, such as staffing and equipment.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Predictive analytics can enhance decision-making processes in healthcare management.


## Future Contributions

- **Incorporating Additional Data:** Using data from multiple years or including external factors like holidays could improve forecasting accuracy.
- **Advanced Modeling Techniques:** Exploring more advanced models such as SARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM networks to enhance forecasting performance.
- **Healthcare System Integration:** Integrating the forecasting tool into healthcare management systems for real-time resource allocation and planning.
